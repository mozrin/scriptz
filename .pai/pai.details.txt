This is a set of scripts that I use to run my development world. I keep it in a git repo

https://github.com/moztopia/scriptz.git

Each command exists in the src/scripts/<command_name> folder under a <command_name>.sh

I would like a script that will pull the latest release from git and put it in a folder called:

$HOME/.local/moztopia/scriptz/* (just the .sh files and none of their individual folders)

AND ... put a symlink for execution in the folder called:

$HOME/.local/bin

If a file already exists in either of these locations, check to see if it has the line:

# by Moztopia

If it has that line, replace it. If it does not have that line, rename our file by putting a moz_ in front of the name. Note this in the log and the output.

Call this script ... install_scriptz.sh ... keep a log because we need to make an uninstall_scriptz.sh later.

Do not give me files that have not changed.
Every file that is changed or new should be given to me in a separate copy/paste block.
